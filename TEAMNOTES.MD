#### What we'll do next


## Status check ins
These are dedicated status check-ins as this is a multi-week project
### Check-in 1
- Four elements: <Header>, <Body>, <Banner>, Simple-Icon 
- The header element will have a main title. We will have to deal with different fonts and styles to make it look professional 
- the body will just have to have good content and simple hover states to potential links and maybe inverted colors/ dark mode
- our banner should be styled nicely and look very professional
- our icon should pertain to what our professional card is. it can have a hoover function or be linked to something of use. 
  
### Class Participation week 8 (10/14)
What did you take away from the portion of class about implementing SimpleColors?
  - Instead of having to make our own dark mode it will help make it for us. 
  - Using simpleColors will help make the project easier for us in terms of design
What did you learn from other groups?
  -Talked to group J 
  -Making seperate files for each element instead of cramming them all into one, this will help our project be more organized 
What are your next steps?
  -Starting to collaborate our ideas and oragnize how we want the project to look.
  -Looking at banners and headers 
  -Decide what Icon we would like to do 
  
### Check-in 2
- we had somewhat of a tough time getting out update() function to work with the <slot> tags 
- we got a good part of our project done like the different files needed for element 
- Writing API's to create the icon 
- writing the CSS for elements 
- working as a team when we get stuck on specific code on the elements
