#### What we did:


#### What we'll do next


## Status check ins
These are dedicated status check-ins as this is a multi-week project
### Check-in 1
- Four elements: <Header>, <Body>, <Banner>, Simple-Icon 
- The header element will have a main title. We will have to deal with different fonts and styles to make it look professional 
- the body will just have to have good content and simple hover states to potential links and maybe inverted colors/ dark mode
- our banner should be styled nicely and look very professional
- our icon should pertain to what our professional card is. it can have a hoover function or be linked to something of use. 
  
### Class Participation week 8 (10/14)
What did you take away from the portion of class about implementing SimpleColors?
  - Instead of having to make our own dark mode it will help make it for us. 
  - Using simpleColors will help make the project easier for us in terms of design
What did you learn from other groups?
  -Talked to group J 
  -Making seperate files for each element instead of cramming them all into one, this will help our project be more organized 
What are your next steps?
  -Starting to collaborate our ideas and oragnize how we want the project to look.
  -Looking at banners and headers 
  -Decide what Icon we would like to do 
  
### Check-in 2
- we had somewhat of a tough time getting out update() function to work with the <slot> tags 
- we got a good part of our project done like the different files needed for element 
- Writing API's to create the icon 
- writing the CSS for elements 
- working as a team when we get stuck on specific code on the elements 
  
  ### Class Participation Week 9 (10/19)
  -From the presentation, our group learned that we would be able to utilize his render function in our project
  -We learned that styling can be used throughout our card to improve the appearance of each section
  We would be able to manipulate the size of the icon and text based on the size of the window displaying it
  -Our next steps are to get the web component to change based on states, and impliment the slots to be customizable by the user
  
### Check-in 3
- We met in Class on Thursday and Tuesday to work and discuss what we need to do / go over areas we are all having problems in
- Met Sunday(oct 24th) VIA facetime to talk about problems we are running into and how we are going to go about fixing things/ also asked questions and talked about problems that everyone was running into/ collaborated as a team to solve issues 
- we have made some progress with adding certian text and smaller changes. More of a syntax error. 
- as a team we are digging deeper into the bigger changes that need to be made and trying solve the best way to go about it 
- the problems we are running into right now are more errors with our code that deal with slots
- out next steps would be to fix the bugs we have in our code. To move further we are going to clean up our code to make it easier to point out the errors are running into. We will continue to work as a group to work on a big chunk of getting the card formatted correctly this week.
